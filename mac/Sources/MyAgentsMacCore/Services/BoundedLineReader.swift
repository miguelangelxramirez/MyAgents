/// Streams the LEADING lines of a file without ever slurping it whole, in time linear in the bytes
/// actually read, and stops the moment the caller has seen enough.
///
/// This exists because the two hand-rolled chunked readers it replaces (`CodexSessionScanner`'s
/// `readLines` and `TranscriptTitle`'s `readTitle`) shared three defects that together pegged a CPU
/// core in the shipped app (measured with `sample(1)` on 2026-07-12: 2258/2259 samples inside
/// `readLines`, the process at 113% CPU and 353 minutes of CPU time):
///
/// 1. **Quadratic buffering.** They appended each 8 KiB chunk to one growing `Data` and then ran
///    `buffer.firstIndex(of: "\n")` over the WHOLE accumulated buffer again — so a single long line
///    re-scanned everything before it, once per chunk. A real rollout on this machine carried a
///    5.2 MB line inside its first 60, which turned one scan into gigabytes of byte-walking. Here
///    the newline search only ever looks at the current chunk's unscanned tail (`cursor...`), and
///    each byte is touched once.
/// 2. **Eager reads.** They materialized ALL `maxLines` lines before the caller inspected any, so a
///    caller that wanted line 6 still paid for lines 7...60. `forEachLine` hands each line over as
///    soon as it is complete and stops when the caller says `.stop`.
/// 3. **No line-size ceiling.** A pasted image or a giant tool result is a single multi-megabyte
///    line that can never be a session name or a title, yet it was buffered in full. A line longer
///    than `maxLineBytes` is now consumed and DISCARDED without ever being held in memory.
///
/// Defensive by construction (METODOLOGIA §4): an unreadable/missing file yields `.unreadable`, and
/// nothing here ever throws.
